# Filmow Redesign

![filmow-readme-description](https://github.com/scsoares/filmow-redesign-extension/assets/121296372/4f37864d-ac78-4ced-8d16-5b3ffd48f12a)

[Filmow](http://filmow.com/) is a brazilian social network based on tracking movies and TV shows, similar to Letterboxd and TV Time but with more social features. It has a solid user base, but its UI looks outdated and hasn't been changed for a long time. I decided to create a Chrome extension that overrides its original CSS and changes the website's layout, making it a little bit cleaner and more modern looking.

If you prefer, read the documentation in <a href="https://github.com/scsoares/filmow-redesign-extension/blob/master/README-pt.md">brazilian portuguese</a> ![brazil](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevenrskelton/flag-icon/master/png/16/country-4x3/br.png)

### Prerequisites:

You only need to have Google Chrome or any other browser installed (I recommend either Edge or Opera).

Install Google Chrome [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=YTUH&gclid=CjwKCAjwm4ukBhAuEiwA0zQxk7nm0WqUTOwysM_j1qS-gkP8u2WvhSQBPqjOn5uNgyKhhk5T_-6f6BoCX6sQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds).

### Installation instructions:

1. Download this repo as a [ZIP file from GitHub](https://github.com/scsoares/filmow_redesign/archive/master.zip).

2. Unzip the file and you should have a folder named `filmow-redesign-extension-main`.

3. In Chrome/Edge/Opera, go to the extensions page (`chrome://extensions`, `edge://extensions` or `opera://extensions`).

4. Enable Developer Mode.

5. Drag the `filmow-redesign-extension-main` folder anywhere on the page to import it (do not delete the folder afterwards, you must have it on your computer for the extension to work).
